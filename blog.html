		<h1> Blog <span class="dark">and other random stuff</span></h1>
		<p> I don't actually keep a blog, but I do occasionally have to urge
		to write something down or share a great recipe.  This page won't be
		updated regularly but it should fill with interesting tidbits eventually.

		<h1> Oct 13, 2011:<span class="dark"> Things I'm looking forward to
			this Winter</span></h1>
		<p> Winter is starting to creep up on us and if I get even one more
		camping trip in this fall I'll be lucky.  It's not all bad though,
		as winter has a few things going for it that are often neglected. 
		I tend to pack summer so tight with trips and activities, that there
		isn't a whole lot of time to enjoy the city.  Yes, despite being a
		small town guy, I've lived in 
		Toronto (rural Ontarians call it 'The Big Smoke') long enough that
		there are things I now love about it.  Here is a short list of things
		I haven't done much since last winter either because I've been sailing 
		at every possible opportunity, or because I've been out of town most
		weekends.</p>

		<p><b> Saturday morning market. </b>  In the winter, we do this more 
		often than not and get most of our food there.  In the summer, 
		it's closer to once a month.</p>

		<p><b> Weekend morning espresso at caf√©s. </b> This is my favourite way
		start the morning on day's when we have time.</p>

		<p><b> Baking sourdough. </b> I'm a bread fanatic and some weeks 
		I'll bake (and eat) three loaves.
		In the summer you pay a double price for this
		because not only is your oven using <i>a lot</i> of power, but we also 
		don't have air conditioning and the waste heat is hard to get out of
		the house.  In the winter, baking is a very efficient thing to do
		because you get to use that energy twice: once to bake your bread,
		once to heat your house.</p>

		<p><b> More time with friends. </b> Easier when your less busy.</p>

		<p><b> Commuting by bike. </b> Last winter, the TTC was the bane of 
		my existence.  I started commuting my bike this spring and have 
		realized that it is vastly superior to transit.  It'll be a bit more
		of an adventure in the winter, but I'm anticipating it raising my 
		overall standard of living.</p>

		<p><b> Planning next summer's adventures. </b> Enough said.</p>

		<h1> Sept 29, 2011:<span class="dark"> The Binomial Inverse
			theorem</span></h1>
		<p> Here is a matrix trick that I'm sure I wasn't taught in school 
		(although my undergrad was embarrassingly lacking in linear algebra).
		Let me prefix everything by saying that I'm currently working on a map
		making code for the 21 cm experiment I'm involved in.  Map making is
		big business in the CMB community and I'm trying to translate what is
		used there to 21 cm.  Map making is all about linear algebra and
		dealing with large matrices and one of the big challenges is inverting
		some of these matrices.</p>

		<p>The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_inverse_theorem"> 
		  binomial inverse theorem</a> tells you how to invert sums of
		matrices for which you already know the inverses.  For a general pair of
		matrices it isn't that useful, since applying the formula is as much work
		as computing an inverse the normal way.  Where the theorem comes in
		handy is when one of the matrices is of low rank.  Lets you have an 
		<i>(n*n)</i> matrix <i>A</i> for which you already have the inverse.
		You have another matrix <i>B</i> that is the same size but only has rank
		<i>m</i> which is a relatively small number.  The inverse of their sum
		can be computed in <i>O(m*n<sup>2</sup>)</i> operations instead of the
		normal <i>O(n<sup>3</sup>)</i>.  This is assuming you already know how
		to rotate <i>B</i> to an <i>(m*m)</i> dense matrix, but this is probably
		how you got <i>B</i> in the first place 
		(or else why would it have such a low rank?).</p>

		<p> All fine and good, but I still need to invert <i>A</i> so I haven't
		gained anything.  This brings us to where the theorem is <b>really</b>
		useful; if <i>A</i> of is full rank but is diagonal or block diagonal.
		This symmetry lets you invert and multiply by <i>A</i> quickly but
		does nothing for <i>A+B</i> unless you use binomial inverse theorem.
		This might seem like a pretty limited range of applicability but this
		situation has come up no less than 3 times in my map making code.</p>
		
		<p> I'm only writing about this wonderful identity because it doesn't 
		seem to be common knowledge in my field.  It's been so useful I figured
		it would be in every map making reference around.  
		</p>
