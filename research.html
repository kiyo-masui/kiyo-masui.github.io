		<p style="clear:both;">
		<a href="http://space.mit.edu/masui-srl">My lab</a> works with wide-field,
		radio-wavelength sky surveys to establish new ways to observe the Universe. These include developing 
		the technique of hydrogen intensity mapping for rapidly surveying large volumes of space, and exploiting
		the recently-discovered phenomena of fast radio bursts (FRBs) as probes of the Universe’s contents.
		This work includes creating digital instrumentation for radio telescopes, developing algorithms for
		analyzing observational data, and making theoretical predictions for the signals we should be looking for.
		</p>
		<p>
		Hydrogen intensity mapping is a technique for rapidly surveying the large-scale distribution of matter in the
		Universe in three dimensions using radio emission from the 21-cm spectral line in hydrogen. Among the premier
		telescopes using this technique is the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment (CHIME), which is the
		main instrument used by Masui’s team. CHIME is part of a new generation of digital radio telescopes that have
		no moving parts and rely on signal processing software running on large compute clusters to focus and steer.
		This allows these telescopes to see large swaths of the sky simultaneously, enabling rapid surveys of the sky.
		</p>
		<p>
		Fast radio bursts are brief and energetic flashes of radio light coming from distant galaxies. CHIME has been
		outfitted with a high-time-resolution backend dedicated to searching for FRBs, allowing it to detect these
		enigmatic transients at an unprecedented rate. Due to the unique properties of FRBs, they carry a record of
		the matter they’ve encountered between their source and our telescopes. Now, a central focus is to use the
		information contained in large samples of observed FRBs to help understand the evolution of the Universe.

        <h2> The Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Survey with the GBT</h2>
		<p>
		I led surveys that pioneered the hydrogen intensity mapping technique, using the
		<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Bank_Telescope">Green Bank Telescope</a> (GBT), which grew
		into a second survey using the
		<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkes_Observatory">Parkes Observatory</a>.
		</p>


		<img src="images/pics/nbody.jpg" alt="Millennium large scale structure" height="300" width="400" align="right" hspace="10" />
		<p> I am interested in the use of the 
		<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observable_universe#Large-scale_structure">large-scale structure of the Universe</a>
		to Understand both the early and modern Universe. The 
		<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronology_of_the_universe#Very_early_universe">first fraction of a second</a>
		of the universe’s evolution is still
		poorly understood, and the discovery that the
		<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expansion_of_the_universe">Universe's expansion</a> is
		accelerating casts doubts into our understanding of its future. We can gain
		insight into these issues by studying how matter is distributed on very
		large scales, much large than galaxies.
		Matter in the universe is organized into large structures of
		many thousands of galaxies called clusters, filaments, and sheets, with
		gigantic voids between them. These structures result from the gravitational
		collapse of tiny perturbations that existed in the early Universe. By
		studying the detailed statistics of the large-scale structure we can learn
		about the processes that generated them. In addition, the expansion of the
		universe pulls on the structure, providing a probe into the Universe's
		acceleration.
		</p>
		<img src="images/pics/gbt.jpg" align="left" height="200" width="267" hspace="10" alt="GBT" />
		<p> In particular I use radio telescopes to make observations
		of the large-scale structure using the technique of
		<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intensity_mapping">hydrogen intensity mapping</a>.
		This is a relatively new way to study the Universe and will allow us to map more of the
		Universe's Volume than ever before.
		</p>
		<p> Tangentially, I am also working on
		<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_radio_burst">fast radio bursts</a> - millisecond
		bursts of radio energy coming from outside our Galaxy - and how they might be used
		to study the Universe.</p>
