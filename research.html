		<h1> Research <span class="dark"></span></h1>
		
		<p> I am interested in the use of the 
		<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen_line">21 cm line</a> 
		for cosmology.  Hydrogen is the most abundant form of matter in the Universe aside from the elusive dark 
		matter.  In its neutral atomic form, hydrogen has a hyperfine energy transition between aligned 
		proton and electron spins 
		and anti-aligned spins.  Transitions between these levels can either emit or absorb a 
		photon with 21 cm wavelength, which can then be detected by radio telescopes.  In addition the
		<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expansion_of_the_universe">expansion of the universe</a>
		stretches photons that have spent more time in transit and thus come from further away.
		We can thus determine from which epoch 
		(<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redshift#Observations_in_astronomy">redshift</a>) 
		the observed radiation originated.</p>
		
		<p> <img src="images/pics/nbody.jpg" alt="Millennium large scale structure" height="300" width="400" align="right" hspace="10" />
		This radiation can be used to map the distribution of neutral hydrogen in the Universe.
		One usually assumes that on large scales (say larger than a thousand galaxies)
		the hydrogen just traces the dark matter, so we 
		can essentially map the distribution of dark matter.  The statistics of the large scale structure of
		dark matter is one of the key observables in cosmology and can tell us all sorts of things 
		about the Universe, from the initial conditions to its late time expansion.  The image to 
		the right is a simulated dark matter map from the 
		<a href="http://www.mpa-garching.mpg.de/galform/millennium/">millennium n-body simulation</a>.
		For scale, the bright spot in the middle is a galaxy super-cluster and contains 
		of order a hundred thousand galaxies.
		Aside from studying dark matter, 21 cm radiation can also be used to study
		a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reionization"> phase transition</a>
		in the hydrogen that occurred 1 billion years after the big bang.</p>

		<p> The distribution of dark matter is also often studied by surveys that count galaxies
		(which are mostly made of dark matter) which are usually detected in the optical bands.
		21 cm radiation has several advantages, the most important being that the Universe
		is transparent to it at all epochs.  Galaxy surveys are difficult in certain redshift 
		ranges.  There is also an epoch before the formation of the first galaxies, the so called 
		dark ages, that is only accessible via 21 cm radiation.  This has great statistical potential
		since most of the observable volume of the Universe is in this epoch.</p>

		<p> The use of 21 cm radiation for cosmology is a fairly new idea and no one has ever 
		actually made a blind detection of 21 cm radiation coming from any cosmologically
		significant distance.  I am working toward making these first detections and performing 
		early science.  I also like to think about the types of measurements that might 
		eventually be possible, given the extraordinary potential of this technique.</p>

		<p> I am also interested in several other areas such as weak lensing and the information content
		of large scale structure.
		</p>
		
		<h1> Current <span class="dark">projects</span></h1>
		
		<p> Here I'll give a quick summary of things I'm currently thinking about.  This section 
		is a bit more technical than above.</p>
		
		<h2> Hydrogen surveys using existing telescopes </h2>
		
		<p> <img src="images/pics/gbt.jpg" align="right" height="200" width="267" hspace="10" alt="GBT" />
		With <a href="http://www.cmu.edu/physics/people/faculty/peterson.html"> Jeff Peterson's </a>
		group, Tzu-Ching Chang, and my adviser Ue-Li, I am part of a team that is performing 21 cm 
		surveys using existing telescopes such as the 
		<a href="http://www.gb.nrao.edu/gbt/">Green Bank Telescope</a> (the picture to the
		right was taken from near GBT's focus).  We are targeting redshifts
		around z=0.8 and are trying to make an initial detection in auto correlation.  The group 
		has already detected the hydrogen by cross correlating with an optical galaxy survey.  This 
		was published 
		<a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v466/n7305/abs/nature09187.html"> here</a>,
		with popular science articles 
		<a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v466/n7305/full/466444a.html">here</a> and 
		<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1063/1.3490487">here</a>.
		While there is much that 
		can be learnt along the way, the ultimate goal is to measure the 
		<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baryon_acoustic_oscillations"> baryon acoustic oscillations </a>
		and constrain the accelerated expansion of the Universe. </p>

		<h2> Foreground subtraction </h2>

		<p> The use of 21 cm radiation for cosmology is plagued by foregrounds.
		These are mostly synchrotron radiation from either within our own galaxy or from other galaxies, and
		subtracting them out is tricky business because they are so much brighter than the signal. 
		We think that it is possible to subtract them out because the foregrounds are spectrally smooth,
		while at each redshift hydrogen emits at only the one frequency.  When stacking all the redshifts
		together, the spectrum of an angular pixel has spectral structure corresponding to the
		hydrogen density variations along the line of sight.  Fourier modes corresponding to small
		scales along the line of sight should be uncontaminated by foregrounds.
		This can still be complicated because experimental effects can cause the different Fourier modes
		to mix in a complicated way.  As part of my involvement in hydrogen surveys, I am always thinking
		about the best way to remove foregrounds and get at the 21 cm signal. </p>

		<h2> Gravity wave fossils </h2>
		
		<p> If 21 cm radiation opens up the 
		<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_the_Big_Bang#Dark_ages">dark ages</a> 
		for observation, it will allow us to map the dark matter over huge volumes 
		(hundreds of cubic gigaparsecs) and down to very small scales (tens of kiloparsecs).  
		The number of independent observable Fourier modes would be immense and such good 
		statistics would allow for the detection of many subtle effects.  One of these effects
		is a signature of primordial gravity waves described in this 
		<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1006.4181">paper</a>.  While it turns out you would need a 
		telescope 100 times the size of the proposed
		<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Square_Kilometre_Array">Square Kilometer Array</a> to have 
		a chance of seeing anything, the effect may nevertheless be observed in the far future.</p>
